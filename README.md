# constraint-validation

Practice JS form validation by building a form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. It should use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not.

Steps to follow:

- Set up a blank HTML document and write the form elements.

- Add the JavaScript code that checks validation as the user progresses through the form. When a user leaves a form field, it should automatically validate that field.

- Test out all possible cases.

- Style validations with CSS by using the :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes.
